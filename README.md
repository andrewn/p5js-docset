p5js docset for Dash
===

Very rough implementation of a [p5.js](https://p5js.org/reference/) docset for the [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) app.

This wraps the [p5.js offline references](https://p5js.org/offline-reference/p5-reference.zip) and indexes the methods.

Usage
---

Download this repo and double-click the "p5js.docset". It will open in Dash.

Limitations
---

This is a quick 30 min hack that only indexes "methods" from the p5.js docs.
